            <p>Are you an indie developer looking to share your work? We'd love to see it! Our goal is to make it easy for you to create a page and reach our community.</p>
            <p>In a future version of this site, developers will be able to create profiles and upload content directly. For now, this is a static demonstration. Content that could be included on a full game page includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Game titles, descriptions, trailers, and screenshots</li>
                <li>Download links (to services like Itch.io, Steam, or direct download)</li>
                <li>Genre tags and filters for discovery</li>
                <li>Developer profiles and team information</li>
                <li>Community reviews and ratings</li>
