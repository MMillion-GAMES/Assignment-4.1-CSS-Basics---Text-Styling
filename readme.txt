Most of the key features that I implemented for this project was from using this website: https://www.w3schools.com 

Included files:
    index.html
    about.html
    submit.html
    style.css

Website Description:
This website was created to be a concept where undiscovered games get the spotlight they deserve!

Website Purpose:
In a world full of big company games, independent developers get overlooked. Zendium was designed to address this problem.
The purpose of this website is to be a discovery tool for both players and developers.

Page Outputs:

    index.html: This page is the main page for the website and showcases the games on the front page and has hyperlinks to the games!
    about.html: Explains the purpose of the website.
    submit.html: Explains how to submit a game of your own to the email provided!

Also, here are all the references to the games I added on the website:
