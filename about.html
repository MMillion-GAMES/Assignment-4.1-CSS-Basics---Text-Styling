            <h2>Our Mission & Purpose</h2>
            <p><strong>The Purpose:</strong> To showcase games made by indie developers, connect them with players, and provide exposure within a passionate community. Indie developers often struggle to be seen among overwhelming AAA game releases. This website addresses this issue by giving developers their own space to showcase their work.</p>
            <p><strong>The Goal:</strong> To create a platform where developers can share their game pages so people can download, play, and interact with the community. We help players who want to have a creative and unique experience with the games they play. Our intended audience is everyone ages 13+ who loves games.</p>
